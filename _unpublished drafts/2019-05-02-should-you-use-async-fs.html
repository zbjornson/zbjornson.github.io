title: "Should you use Node.js' sync or async fs methods?"
date: 2019-05-02 20:37:00 -0800.
excerpt: "The overhead of async fs functions might outweigh their benefit."
---

<p>Node.js provides both async and sync versions of all <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html">file system ("fs")</a>a> functions. For example, there's `fs.close(fd, callback)` and `fs.closeSync(fd)`. The async versions unblock the event loop, allowing your app to do other work. However, async functions have inherent overhead, and some of the underlying syscalls can execute in less time than that overhead, potentially making the sync version a better choice than the async version.</p>

<p>The conditions when syscalls can block for significant amounts of time are not entirely obvious or documented anywhere authoritatively, and can depend on system load/state. Below I've benchmarked the async and sync versions of some of the more common fs functions, and listed some scenarios when the syscalls may block for extended periods. (These lists are not complete by any means, and are primarily geared toward Linux.)</p>

<p>Benchmarks run on Ubuntu 18 with a locally-attached, ext4-formatted SSD on an otherwise-idle system, Node.js 10. Repeated 250 times for each of 1000 files.</p>

NFS, remote FUSE, etc. will generally be slow, but local file systems are generally fast.</td>

<p>In these benchmarks, the sync versions range from 9 to 80x (47 to 85 microseconds) faster than their async counterparts. Interestingly, it's not a constant factor that could be attributable to threading overhead as one might expect.</p>

<p>If your app doesn't involve any of the listed scenarios (e.g. it only uses regular files on a local block device), and if occasional, unpredictable blockage wouldn't be catastrophic, you might consider using the sync fs methods.</p>

<p>Regarding `read()` and `write()`, I recently made a prototype of new versions of those functions that use `io_uring` for kernel-level async I/O instead of Node.js' threadpool. The results are promising, with a >40x reduction in overhead. This requires version 5.1 of the Linux kernel plus a custom patch, so it won't be making its way into libuv right this minute, but that is my ultimate goal.</p>
